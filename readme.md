## Godot wayland protocols

Trying to implement some wayland protcols for fun. Mostly protocols which are supported on Niri will be implemented.

Planned protocol implementations:

| Protocol                    | Status                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ext-workspace-v1            | WIP                                                                                              |
| wlr-screencopy-unstable-v1  | Initial explaratory implementation                                                               |
| ext-session-lock-v1         | TODO                                                                                             |
| wlr-layer-shell-unstable-v1 | TODO. (Might not be needed, as there is a implementation in godot repo, which is not merged yet) |
